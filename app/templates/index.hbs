    OttoMap converts your TribeNet turn reports to Worldographer maps.
    It's free and open source, and you can use it to create maps for any game.
    OttoMap comes in two flavors: a desktop server and a cloud server (coming soon).
</p>

<p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600 sm:max-w-md lg:max-w-none">
    You are using the desktop server.
    It is single-user version of the OttoMap web server.
    Everything runs on your computer; nothing is shared with other players.
